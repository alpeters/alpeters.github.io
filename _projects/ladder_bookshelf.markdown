A fun DIY project I designed to house my book collection and to have the pleasure of building something physical with my hands again. Ladder shelves seem to be all the rage these days, but to the best of my knowledge this is a unique design, using dowels to support the books rather than flat shelves. Everything is press fitted together - not a single fastener required! The real challenge was that everything was cut and drilled with hand tools on a rough concrete ledge in front of my apartment, making precise cuts and straight holes rather tricky. Luckily I had Elyse to help!
